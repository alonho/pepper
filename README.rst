======
Pepper
======

Pepper was conceived while I was staring at ugly code, I wanted to make it more readable (conform with PEP8 and my brain).
Pepper is source to source processor that reads python code and writes it back properly formatted whitespace-wise.
Pepper DOES NOT change anything other than whitespace so unless a bug is lurking somewhere it should never break the code or change it's behavior.
Pepper DOES NOT comply to PEP8 in several issues i had no will to solve like maximum length of a line (who uses a 80 chars terminal these days anyway..).

Whats next?
===========

Started working on coding conventions automatic refactoring, still unsure whether such a thing is usable.
